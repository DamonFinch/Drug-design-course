# Topic 4 - Force fields, molecular mechanics and dynamics

In this serie of lessons, the general concepts of a force field are explained. Buidling further upon this, concept of moelcular mechanics and molecular dynamics are highlighted.


## Prepare yourself:

It is highly recommended that you prepare yourselves by go through the following scientific paper and movie well in advance:

- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9awBW-Gczk&t=85s" target="_blank">Molecular mechanics and dynamics</a> [YouTube - 5'12"]
- <a href="/Topic_04/Computational_chemistry_paper.pdf" download>Computational chemistry: molecular mechanics, dynamics and force fields</a> [pdf]


## Course manual:

- <a href="/Topic_04/7-Molecular_mechanics_and_conformational_analysis.pdf" download>Chapter 7: Molecular mechanics and conformational analysis</a> [pdf]
- <a href="/Topic_04/8-Molecular_dynamics.pdf" download>Chapter 8: Molecular dynamics</a> [pdf]


## Slides:

- <a href="/Topic_04/Slides_04.pdf" download>Lecture slides of topic 04</a> [pdf]


## Finished?

Then it is time to move to the fifth and last topic of this course: [Topic 5: Artificial intelligence and virtual reality in computational drug design](/Topic_05).
